# ðŸŽ“ Academic Career Recommender System

This project is a complete **Data Science and Machine Learning solution** that recommends the most suitable **academic career path** for a student based on their personal and academic profile. It predicts a career field using a trained ML model on real-world student-like data, helping guide students in making informed academic and career decisions.


##  What This Project Does
- **Predicts Career Field** from 15+ student attributes
- **Applies Data Science Pipeline**: EDA â†’ Feature Engineering â†’ Model Training â†’ Deployment
- Built with a **Machine Learning Model** (XGBoost Classifier)
- Fully interactive **Streamlit Web App**
- Designed for students, academic advisors, and educational counselors

## Why This is a Data Science & ML Project
This project follows a full **end-to-end data science workflow**, including:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Using `pandas` to clean and structure raw data
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting meaningful features (e.g. GPA, Skills, Internships)
- **Label Encoding & Clustering**: Converting categorical labels to numeric for model training
- **Model Building**: Training an **XGBoost** multi-class classifier
- **Evaluation**: Testing the model and resolving feature-label mismatches
- **Deployment**: Creating an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time predictions
